How to edit tool tips in EDNA2html
==================================

The default text for the tool tips is stored in the file
EDNA2html_tooltips_en_GB.txt.

The file consists of placeholder/text pairs, with one pair per line
(blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored). The placeholder/text
pairs are separated by a colon character, for example:

place_holder: This is some tool tip text

Editing the tool tip text in the output HTML documents is a matter of
locating the appropriate placeholder in the tool tips file. The --debug_help
command line option for EDNA2html is intended to help with this.

When --debug_help is specified on the command line, the name of the
placeholder is displayed when the mouse moves over a tool-tipped element
in the browser (instead of the normal tool tip text).

Creating and using an alternative tool tip file
===============================================

An alternative tool tip file can be created by copying the default
EDNA2html_tooltips_en_GB.txt file and editing it as required, then
using the --help_file=... command line option for EDNA2html in order
to specify that this new file be used instead.
